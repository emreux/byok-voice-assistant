"""The terminal status line - the whole interface of phase 1 (item 1.11).

There is no window and no tray icon yet, and a voice assistant gives the user
nothing to look at by design. So one line of the terminal has to answer the
only question they have while nothing is being said: is it listening, is it
thinking, or has it stopped?

**One line, overwritten.** The state changes four times in a turn. Printed as
four lines each, a minute of use buries what was actually said under a hundred
lines of `thinking`. `rich`'s `Live` keeps the state at the bottom and lets
what was heard and answered scroll past above it.

**It does not animate.** The line is redrawn when the state changes and at no
other time - no spinner, no refresh thread. Rule 4 of section 3.1 gives the
event loop fifty milliseconds, and a status line is not what should spend them.

**No sentence is written here.** The pack answers first and the English
constants below are the end of the chain (section 3.12), as everywhere else.
A state is looked up by its own name, so a state added in a later phase needs
a line in `TEXT` and nothing else.
