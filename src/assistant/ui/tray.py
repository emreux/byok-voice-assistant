"""The tray icon (design.md section 3.1, phase 4.3; 17 Sep 2026).

A second surface over the same state machine as the status line, and like
it owning no behaviour of its own: what the icon shows is what `on_state`
and `on_mode` say, and what its menu does is what the key and Ctrl+C
already do. `run --tray` puts it up beside the terminal, which stays -
there is no window (decision 3 of section 12), and the terminal is where
what was said still scrolls past.

**pystray runs on a thread of its own.** `run_detached` starts it and the
shell's messages arrive there. A click on the menu is one of them, and
everything a click asks of the assistant is posted to the event loop with
`call_soon_threadsafe` - the road the hotkey takes (`audio/capture.py`),
so that nothing about the assistant is touched from two threads. The
other direction, the loop telling the icon what to show, is a property
set on the icon; pystray hands it to the shell from whichever thread sets
it, and the shell's icon calls take a millisecond or two, which is inside
rule 4 of section 3.1.

**Drawn, not shipped.** The icon is a disc in the state's colour - the
reading the status line gives in words - filled while the microphone is
live and a ring while it is not. Each is drawn once with Pillow when the
tray is built, so that a change of state costs a lookup and not a picture.

**No sentence is written here.** The menu's labels come from the pack, and
the state's name is the status line's own label under the same key, so a
pack that translated the terminal has translated the tray.
