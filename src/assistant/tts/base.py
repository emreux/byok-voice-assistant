"""What every speech engine is reduced to (design.md section 3.5).

The contract is one sentence long: **a provider yields 16-bit signed mono PCM,
little endian, at the rate it declares in `sample_rate`.** Windows speaks at
16 kHz, Azure at 24; both are asked for raw PCM rather than a compressed
format, so whatever plays the audio never has to decode anything.

Streaming is not optional here, and `sentences` below is why. The model writes
a reply in fragments over a second or two. Waiting for the last one before
making a sound would add the whole generation time to the latency of section
4; instead a sentence is handed to the engine the moment it is whole, and the
first one is usually speaking while the model is still writing the second.

Text normalisation - reading `25.08.2026` and `%14` the way a person would -
is phase 3.4 and lives in `tts/normalize.py` when it arrives. It belongs in
front of this module, not inside it.
