"""Windows' own speech engine (design.md section 3.5, item 1.7).

The voice of phases 1 and 2, and the offline fallback for ever after: no key,
no network, no cost, installed on every Windows machine. It is not a pleasant
voice; Azure Neural arrives in phase 3.4 and this stays as the thing that
still works when the network does not.

**The Turkish voice lives in the other registry hive.** Windows keeps modern
voices under `Speech_OneCore` and `SAPI.SpVoice.GetVoices()` reads only
`Speech`, which is why `Microsoft Tolga` is installed on the owner's machine
and invisible to SAPI. The usual advice is to copy the registry key across,
which needs an administrator and edits a machine-wide setting. It is not
necessary: a token can be named by its full registry path, and both hives can
be enumerated through `SpObjectTokenCategory`. Measured on the target machine -
Tolga reads a Turkish sentence this way with nothing installed and nothing
changed.

Two traps sit behind the COM calls. Synthesis blocks, so it runs in a worker
thread (rule 4 of section 3.1); and a thread that has not initialised COM
cannot create a SAPI object at all, which is why every worker does so first.
