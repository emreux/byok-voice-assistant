"""Whisper on the CPU, off the event loop (design.md section 3.4).

The target machine has no discrete GPU, so this runs `faster-whisper` with int8
weights on four physical cores. That is seconds of work per utterance, and the
single most important thing in this file is where those seconds are spent:
**in a worker thread, never on the event loop.** Rule 4 of section 3.1 gives
anything awaited in `app.py` a 50 ms budget; a transcription on the loop would
freeze the reminder scheduler, the announce queue and audio capture together
until it finished. CTranslate2 releases the GIL, so a thread is enough and a
second process is not needed.

The model is loaded on first use, also in a thread - about a gigabyte of
weights - and `load()` exists so `app.py` can pay that cost at startup instead
of inside the user's first sentence. When the weights cannot be loaded - no
network on the first run, a broken cache - the failure is named
(`ModelUnavailableError`), so that `assistant run` can say so in a sentence.

**The recording is filtered for speech before it is decoded.** `vad_filter`
runs the same Silero network `audio/vad.py` uses over the whole recording and
hands the decoder only what it kept. Measured on this machine (2026-09-05): a
recording of a quiet room produced a subtitle credit without the filter and no
segment at all with it, while a real sentence came back unchanged. What is
left after that is judged by the decoder's own `no_speech_prob` per segment -
a hallucinated credit over the trailing silence scores 0.9 next to a real
sentence at 0.05 - and reported to the state machine as one number.

**The recogniser is told what to expect.** Section 3.4's free trick:
`initial_prompt` is context for the decoder. It is the locale pack's sentence
(`[stt] prompt`) with the names of the installed apps where its `{apps}` is -
a sentence rather than a list, because the decoder is being shown what
speech in that language looks like, and with the names *as people say them*
(`tools/system.py`, `AppCatalog.spoken_names`). The library keeps the *last*
223 tokens of a long prompt, which would cut the sentence's own words off the
front, so the fit is done here, once, when the model and its tokenizer are
loaded: names go in, in the offered order, while the whole stays under
`PROMPT_TOKENS`. Until 2026-09-13 the prompt was the forty shortest names -
`Run`, `dfrgui`, `services` - and PyCharm was not among them.

**One decode, so many tokens, and a loop is not words.** The library's
default retries a decode it doubts at five rising temperatures. Measured
2026-09-13 with `small` and a synthetic Turkish voice: "PyCharm'ı aç" was
decoded six times over 25-32 s and was wrong at the end as at the start;
"FortiClient VPN'i aç" took 15-18 s for the same wrong words a single decode
gives in 3 s. So the decode runs once, at temperature zero. What the ladder
was also catching - a decoder going round in circles ("TÜCHAR MAĞĞĞĞ...",
448 tokens, 13.7 s) - is bounded instead by `max_new_tokens`, from the
length of the audio, and then thrown away by its compression ratio, the
library's own sign of a loop. The transcript is then empty over audio that
held speech, and `app.hear` answers with "say it again" rather than handing
the model a word nobody said.
