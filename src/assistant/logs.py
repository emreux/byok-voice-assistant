"""The application log (item 1.11).

One line per turn, holding what it cost: the tokens, how many tools ran, and
the price in dollars - the same number the turn's row in `usage_log` carries
(2.4), so that the log and `assistant cost` never disagree about a turn. A
turn the fast path answered without the model (2.5) is written by its intent
instead: no request was made, so there is no count to write.

Three decisions are worth stating, because each of them is about what is *not*
written.

**Nothing goes to the terminal.** `loguru` installs a handler on stderr when it
is imported, and phase 1 has exactly one line of terminal to say what the
assistant is doing (`ui/status.py`). Setting up takes that handler away rather
than adding to it, which also means starting twice does not log everything
twice.

**The numbers are written down; the words are not.** A voice assistant that
keeps a plaintext transcript of everything said near a microphone is a
liability nobody asked for, and the retention rules that would cover one
(section 3.7) are phase 4. The screen shows what was said, and forgets it.

**No API key can reach the file.** Nothing here logs text that could carry one,
and `diagnose` is off so that a traceback cannot smuggle one out in the value
of a local variable - which is exactly where it would be, one frame below the
adapter (section 10). The masking filter section 5 describes belongs with the
first thing that logs a provider's own words back to us.

    A turn that heard nothing never happened - a tapped key, or a recording of

    A turn that *failed* is kept, by the kind of failure and nothing else. It
    reports no tokens, and written as `turn: 0 in, 0 out` it read as a free
    success - the log of 2026-09-04 had one and nothing said which of the
    three sentences the user had heard. The provider's own words stay out: they
    are where a key could travel, and the masking filter of section 5 is not
    written yet.

    So is a turn that was *missed*: speech the recogniser could not turn into
    words. It cost nothing, which is exactly why the line matters - a user
    reporting that the assistant "does nothing" and a log full of these have
    already answered each other. The decoder's doubt goes with it when there
    was one. The words are still not written down: a transcript nothing stood
    behind is no more worth keeping than one that was.

    A turn the fast path answered (2.5) is written by its intent and the
