"""`assistant setup` - the three questions phase 1 asks (design.md section 3.3).

Provider, key, model, and the language the assistant speaks. The fourteen step
wizard of section 3.3 - device tests, tool probe, latency measurement, a
fallback model - is phase 4.5; what is here is the smallest thing that can
produce a working `config.toml`.

Two rules shape the code more than the questions do.

**Nothing is written until the wizard finishes.** The key is checked against
the provider before it is kept, and both the key and the settings are stored in
the last step. A run that was abandoned, or a key that turned out to be
revoked, leaves the machine exactly as it was found.

**No user-facing sentence lives in this module.** The wizard asks for a
question by key; the `Prompter` turns that key into words, taking them from the
locale pack and falling back to `TEXT` below - English, which section 3.12
names as the end of the chain. That is also why the tests can script a wizard
run without repeating a single sentence, and why adding a language changes no
line of this file.

**A model is not taken at its word (2.6).** Every model can be asked a
question; not every one can be asked to do something, and the one that
cannot fails silently, in prose, at two in the morning. So the model the
user picks is sent one request with one tool before it is accepted
(`llm/probe.py`, section 3.2), and a model that does not call the tool is
not taken - the list is offered again. The verdict on the model that was
taken goes to the `settings` table, which makes this the first thing to
touch the database on a fresh machine.

Phase 2 adds what the catalogue already has room for: a provider that needs no
key at all (Ollama) and one that needs a `base_url`. Both are questions about
a `ProviderEntry` field, so they arrive with the adapter that makes them real.
