"""The limits of design.md section 3.11: what one turn may do, what a day may cost.

The loop of `core.py` has no exit of its own. A model that did not get what
it wanted from a tool asks again, with the same arguments, and would go on
asking - every round a request paid for (architecture guide section 12). So
the loop is given a referee for the turn, `TurnGuard`, asked before every
tool call and answering either "go" or the sentence the model reads instead
of a result. Three limits are its to keep: how many calls a turn may make,
how many times in a row the same call may be made, and - through
`Limits.output_tokens`, which the loop hands to the provider - how long an
answer may be. The two spending limits, the gate's look-back window and the
turn's own clock ride in the same `Limits`, because section 3.11 is one table;
who reads which row is written on the class.

**Written here and not in an adapter** (invariant 3). Inside an adapter each
limit would be written three times, once per vendor, and one of the three
would be forgotten. This file sees a `ToolCall` and nothing of any vendor.

**The refusal is a tool result, not a lecture.** It goes back in the tool's
own channel, where the model reads it as what the tool said and moves on -
a user message it could argue with, and would.

**A repeat is the same name with the same arguments,** judged by the hash
`store/repos.py` writes into `tool_audit`, so that the guard, the gate and the
audit row agree about what "the same call" means. Not by the call's id:
Gemini sends none (measured 2026-09-09, `id=""` on every call), and two ids
for the same request are exactly the repeat that has to be caught.

**Every call the model makes counts, refused or not.** A refusal that did
not count would leave a model repeating itself with no ceiling on the rounds
it costs; counted, the eighth refusal is the last thing the model is offered
tools for.

The numbers are the defaults of the section 3.11 table, written once, here.
`config.py` takes its `[limits]` defaults from this class, and what
`config.toml` names replaces them through `from_settings`.
