"""The agent loop (design.md item 1.9 and 2.1c, architecture guide section 1).

The whole product is arranged around a handful of lines: put what the user
said at the end of the recent conversation, send it to the model, and if the
model asks for a tool, run it through the gate of section 3.9, put the result
back in and ask again. It is a loop because one sentence can take several
requests - "yarın Ahmet'i aramayı hatırlat" is the time, then the reminder,
then the answer - and the answer is whatever the model says once it stops
asking. Phase 1 ran this once per turn, with nothing to go round for; phase
2.1c gave it its `while`.

Five decisions here are worth more than the code that implements them.

**A turn is not a message.** The window of section 3.7 keeps the last twelve
*turns*, where a turn is what the user said plus everything that followed it.
Counting messages instead would be simpler and would eventually cut between a
tool call and the result that answers it - a shape every provider rejects. The
cut is at what the user said, so a tool call and its result stay together.

**Nothing is remembered until the answer is whole.** The conversation is
replaced in one assignment at the end of the turn. A dropped connection, the
sixty second `THINKING` timeout of section 3.1, a cancelled turn: all of them
leave the history exactly as it was, so the user repeats themselves and gets a
clean turn rather than one built on half of a previous one.

**The gate is handed in, not imported.** This file never sees `policy.py`. The
composition root builds the gate and passes it; a test passes a fake; and the
loop cannot be talked into running a tool any other way, because it has no
other way (invariant 1). Offering tools without a gate is refused outright.
So is the one who answers a tool's question: `confirm` comes with each turn
from `app.py`, because the microphone that hears the yes lives there and the
gate that needs it is built first - neither can be built holding the other.

**The system prompt is not part of the conversation.** It is prepended to each
request instead of living in the history, which keeps it out of reach of the
window and byte-identical from turn to turn - the one thing prompt caching
needs (architecture guide section 2).

**The words leave as they arrive** (2.8, architecture guide section 11).
`stream_reply` hands each piece of text out the moment the provider produced
it, so that `app.py` has the first sentence spoken while the model is still
writing the second. What the turn came to as a whole - the text, what it
cost over every request, how it ended, how many tools ran - is only known
once the stream is over, and is left in `last_answer` for whoever read it;
`reply` is that reader, for a caller with no use for the pieces. A tool
round is announced through `on_tool_round` the moment the loop turns to run
one: that is when the silence a tool costs begins, and the clock of the
filler in `app.py` starts on it.

The loop has no exit of its own, so it does not count for itself: the limits
of section 3.11 live beside this file in `limits.py`, and a `TurnGuard` is
asked before every call. Beside this file rather than inside an adapter,
because written in an adapter they would be written three times, and one of
the three would be forgotten (invariant 3).
