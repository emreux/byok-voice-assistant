"""The one path from a model-produced `ToolCall` to a running tool (design.md section 3.9).

The model cannot tell an instruction of the user's from text it read somewhere
- both are tokens in the same window - so the only defence that holds is
outside the model: code between the model's request and the action. This
module is that code, and there is deliberately no second way to run a tool.

`dispatch` is a referee. It looks the tool up, reads the risk the tool
declared for itself, and either refuses, asks, or runs. Whatever happens it
answers in words, because the answer goes back to the model as the tool's
result: a refusal the model can read is a turn that continues, an exception
that escapes is a turn that dies.

**It writes before it runs.** With an `AuditRepo` in hand the gate opens a
`tool_audit` row *before* the tool's body starts and closes it afterwards;
a refusal is one row that is closed as it is written. A crash between the
two leaves a row that says `started` and nothing more - which is the truth,
and is what section 3.11 builds "I tried, and I do not know whether it
worked" on. The order is the whole point; do not move the write after the
call to save a millisecond.

The answers are English constants and stay that way. They are addressed to
the model, not the user, so the locale chain of section 3.12 does not apply.
