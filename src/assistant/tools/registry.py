"""How a Python function becomes a tool the model can call (design.md section 3.9).

The model sees a tool as JSON: a name, a description and a parameter schema.
We write Python functions. `build_spec` is the one translation between the
two - the function's name, its docstring and its signature - so that no tool
ever describes itself by hand and drifts from what it actually accepts.

`@tool` adds the one thing the model must never decide, the risk level, and
`ToolRegistry` is the explicit list of what is on offer. Nothing registers
itself at import time: the composition root builds the registry it wants, and
a test builds its own.
