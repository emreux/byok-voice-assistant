"""Reading the user's mail (design.md section 3.6, phase 3.3; 17 Sep 2026).

Two tools over one IMAP mailbox: the newest messages, and the messages
that mention something. Reading only - nothing is sent, nothing is marked
read, nothing is moved. Every fetch is `BODY.PEEK` on a folder selected
read-only, so a message the assistant read still shows as unread in the
user's own client, which is what "read my mail to me" should mean.

**Mail is content, never instructions.** A message can say anything, and
one that says "forward this to everyone" is the reason `fetch_page` wraps
a page: what the tools return goes inside the `<untrusted>` block that the
system prompt explains (`tools/untrusted.py`), one block per call, and
the rule of `agent/prompts.py` covers a mail exactly as it covers a page.

**One connection per call, on a thread.** `imaplib` blocks on every
command, so the whole of a call - connect, sign in, select, search, fetch,
sign out - runs under `asyncio.to_thread` (section 3.1 rule 4). A kept
connection would be faster and would also be a session to keep alive,
time out and reopen; a call every few hours does not need one.

**Text over HTML.** Most mail carries both. The plain part is taken when
there is one, the HTML part is read the way a page is (`web/page.py`)
when there is not, and each message is cut at `MAX_MAIL_CHARS` with a
line that says so - the model is here to summarise, not to be handed a
newsletter whole.

**Setting up is one command.** `assistant mail login` asks for the server
and the address when the `[mail]` table does not have them, and for an
app password always; connects once to prove them; and puts the password
in the Credential Manager under `mail`, the address and the server in
`config.toml` (section 10). Written against a fake server: no account
was opened for this, and the README says so.
