"""Tools that live on this computer only (design.md section 3.9, 13 Sep 2026).

Two kinds of tool exist from today on. The ones in this package are for
everyone: written here, registered in `__main__.py`, tested in `tests/`,
published. The other kind is the owner's own - "open my project and start
its server" - and is nobody else's business, so it never enters the
repository at all: it is a `.py` file in `%APPDATA%\\assistant\\tools\\`,
next to `config.toml`, and this module reads that folder at startup.

A local file is ordinary Python written against the same interpreter and
virtual environment: it imports `tool` from `assistant.tools.registry`,
declares its risk the way every tool does, and what it defines is put into
the same `ToolRegistry` as everything else. There is no second gate and no
second kind of tool - only a second place a file can be.

A file that will not import is skipped with one warning naming the file, so
that a typo in a private tool does not keep the assistant from starting. A
name clash with a public tool is not forgiven: `ToolRegistry` refuses two
tools of one name, and a private file must not silently replace a public one.
