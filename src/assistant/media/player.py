"""Where a media request goes, and what actually opens.

The lookups in `youtube.py` and `spotify.py` know how to name a thing; this
knows which of them to ask, what to do before starting something, and how to
say what happened. The tools in `tools/media.py` are three docstrings over
the three methods below.

**Three rules decide almost everything here.**

*Play, do not search.* A request for a song ends at an address that starts
playing - `music.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>` - and never at a results page the
user then has to click. Whether that is possible is a property of the
service, not of the request: YouTube Music can be asked for an identifier and
Spotify cannot be asked for one without credentials this build does not have
(`spotify.py`). What Spotify can be asked for is the one recording with a
given ISRC, and Deezer names that code for free (`deezer.py`) - so a Spotify
request opens the exact recording when Deezer knows it and a search when it
does not, and the answer *says* which, and that nothing started. What is
never allowed is opening a page and reporting a song.

*One at a time.* Every song opens in the assistant's own browser window,
and the previous one is closed once the new one is there (`window.py`); what
plays elsewhere - the Spotify application, a tab of the user's own - is
paused through the Windows session rather than by a media key
(`now_playing.py`), and two requests that overlap are served one after the
other rather than racing each other into two windows.

*The failure sentence forbids the sentence the model would otherwise reach
for.* A model told only "the search failed" still tends to tell the user
something is playing. Every failure here therefore ends with what must not be
said, which is cheap and works.
