"""Finding the identifier YouTube needs, so that the model never invents one.

A YouTube address plays exactly one thing: `watch?v=` and eleven characters
that mean nothing, are not derived from the title, and cannot be worked out
from anything the model knows. Asked for one anyway, a language model writes
eleven plausible characters and YouTube answers *"This video isn't available
anymore"*. That sentence is the reason this module exists. Nothing here asks
the model for an identifier; the identifier is looked up first and only then
is an address built, which is also why the model is never left to reach for
`open_url` when the user asks for music (`tools/media.py`).

**Two services, two lookups, for the same reason each.**

A *song* goes to YouTube Music through `ytmusicapi`, which speaks the site's
own InnerTube API without a key. Its `songs` filter answers with recordings
rather than lyric videos and hour-long mixes, which is what somebody who says
"play X" means.

A *video* goes to YouTube's ordinary results page, and the identifier is read
out of `ytInitialData` - the JSON the page's own script reads to draw the
list. That is a scrape, so every step of it is written to fail into a
sentence: a consent wall, a page whose shape changed, a search with no hits
and a refused request all leave here as `SearchError`, never as a `KeyError`
in the middle of a turn. The documented alternative, InnerTube's
`/youtubei/v1/search`, needs an undocumented key lifted out of the same page
and is slower - a second thing to break, for nothing.

**No language and no country are sent.** No `hl`, no `gl`, no
`Accept-Language`: the code carries no locale constant (design.md section
3.12), and both services answer for the user's own region without being told.
