"""From a provider id in a file to an adapter that can answer (section 3.2).

`providers.toml` lists what the user may choose; `ADAPTERS` lists what this
build can actually construct. Keeping the two apart is what lets a provider be
added by editing data - but it also means they can disagree, so every failure
here is spelled out. A user who mistypes a provider name, or whose key was
never stored, gets a sentence telling them what to do instead of a traceback.

The key is fetched from the Windows Credential Manager at the last moment and
handed straight to the adapter. It is never stored on the entry, never logged,
and never written back to disk.

Since 2.7 most of the catalogue is one adapter under different addresses:
`openai_compat` with the entry's `base_url`. The one entry with no address
of its own, `custom`, gets it from the caller - the wizard asked the user
for it and `config.toml` kept it - and is refused, in a sentence, without.
