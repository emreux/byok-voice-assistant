"""The contract every LLM provider is reduced to (design.md section 3.2).

Providers disagree about almost everything: Anthropic sends content blocks,
OpenAI sends a string plus `tool_calls`, Gemini sends `parts`. Tool definitions,
tool results and streaming events differ again. Let those differences reach the
rest of the application and the project is nailed to one vendor.

So the application sees only this module: five value types and one protocol.
An adapter translates its vendor's shapes into these on the way in and out, and
that is the only place vendor knowledge is allowed to live.

Phase 1 shipped a single adapter and called `stream` with `tools=[]`. The tool
types were defined here from the start anyway - the permission gate and the
agent loop of phase 2 are written against them, and retrofitting a type this
central breaks every call site (design.md section 8). Phase 2.1 turned them
on, and two things the first real round trip taught are recorded on the types
themselves: a tool result carries the name of the tool as well as the id of
the call, and a call carries back whatever opaque token the provider attached
to it.
