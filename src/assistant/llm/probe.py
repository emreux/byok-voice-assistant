"""The tool-use probe: does this model actually call a tool? (design.md section 3.2, 2.6)

Every model can be asked a question; not every model can be asked to *do*
something. A tool is offered to it as a schema, and a model that was never
trained on that shape writes the answer in prose instead of calling the tool
- and nothing complains. `ModelInfo.supports_tools` has said `None`, "nobody
has tested this", since phase 1. The whole of the secretary depends on the
answer being yes, so the setup wizard does not take the user's choice of
model until this file has asked it once, and `assistant run` asks again when
the answer is a week old (the provider may have changed the model since).

**One request, one tool, one question.** The tool is the canonical
`get_current_time(city)` of section 3.2; the question is one that ought to
make the model reach for it - "what time is it in Istanbul" cannot be
answered from memory. A model that emits a call to that tool passes,
whatever it says beside it; a model that only writes fails, with the reason
written down. The time to the first token is measured on the way, because
the request is being made anyway and section 3.3 wants the number.

**The question comes from the locale pack.** Section 3.2 wanted it Turkish
so that one request checks both tool calling and understanding the user's
language. Both still hold: the pack's `[probe] question` asks in the
product's language, and `QUESTION` below is the English at the end of the
chain (section 3.12), as for every other sentence. This file carries no
Turkish.

**The verdict is remembered in the `settings` table**, under
`probe:<provider>:<model>`, as one line of JSON with the time it was
reached. `remembered` returns it while it is younger than
`PROBE_TTL_SECONDS`, and `None` - "ask again" - once it is not, or when it
cannot be read: a verdict of unknown age is no verdict.
