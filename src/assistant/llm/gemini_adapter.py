"""Google Gemini, translated into the protocol (design.md section 3.2).

This is the only file in the project that imports `google.genai`. Everything
Gemini does differently is absorbed here: the system prompt is a separate
config field rather than a message, the assistant speaks under the role
"model", tool results travel as function responses, and a streamed tool call
can arrive in pieces.

That last one is the reason this adapter is more than a field rename. Gemini
marks an unfinished call with `will_continue`, and the protocol promises a
`ToolCall` is never half-built - the permission gate of section 3.9 cannot
judge an action it can only see the beginning of. So unfinished calls are
dropped and only the completed one is emitted.

Two more of Gemini's ways were learned the day tools were first turned on
(2026-09-09, against the real API), and both are absorbed here. A function
response must name the function - the id alone is refused - so the protocol's
tool result carries the name and this file passes it on. And Gemini 3 signs
every function call it makes with an opaque *thought signature* that has to
travel back on the very same part when the call is resent as history, or the
request is refused; the signature rides on `ToolCall.signature` and nothing
between here and the loop looks at it.
