"""Locale packs - everything that depends on the language (design.md 3.12).

The product is not pinned to one language, and the way that is kept true is
mechanical: no module carries a sentence in a language other than English, and
every language-dependent value lives in one TOML file per language, next to
this one. Adding a language is a file and a pull request, not a code change.

**The fallback chain runs requested pack -> `en` -> the constant in the code.**
The last link is not a table somewhere: it is the English sentence written
beside the code that says it, passed to `say` as the default. That is why
`en.toml` carries no sentences at all - a second English copy here would be a
second thing to keep in step - and why a language nobody has translated still
produces a working assistant with an English interface.

**Sentences fall back; identity does not.** `code`, `name`, the speech hint and
the voice preference default to the locale itself rather than to English. An
English voice reading German, or a recogniser told to expect English while a
German speaks, are both worse than having no preference at all: the first is
merely unpleasant, the second means the model never sees what was said.
