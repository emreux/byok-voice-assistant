"""Starting with Windows (design.md section 8, phase 4.2; 17 Sep 2026).

One value under the user's own `Run` key, and nothing else: no service,
no scheduled task, no administrator. `HKCU\\...\\Run` is what Windows reads
at sign-in for this user alone, and a value there is a decision the user
can see and undo in Task Manager's start-up page, or with `assistant
autostart off`. The command registered is the assistant as it is
installed on this machine - the console script beside the interpreter
that is running - with the tray icon, because a program that starts by
itself should have a place to be quit from (`ui/tray.py`).

`winreg` is behind a small protocol so that the tests write to a
dictionary rather than to the developer's sign-in.
