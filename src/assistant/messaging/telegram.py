"""Telegram, as the user, through Telegram's own API (spec section 6,
decision T1 of 2026-09-14).

**Why the user's account and not a bot.** A bot cannot write first, and a
message from a bot is a message from a bot. Telegram's API terms allow a
third-party client on a user account - "obtain your own api_id" - and
Telethon is that client, asyncio-native and maintained (Pyrogram was
archived in December 2024). The `api_id` and `api_hash` are the user's,
from my.telegram.org (two minutes, and consistent with bringing one's own
key); the hash "is secret and cannot be revoked", so it never ships in the
repository and lives, with the session, in the Credential Manager. A
`StringSession` is full access to the account, which is why.

**This program sends; it does not read.** `receive_updates=False`: no
update loop, nothing listened to, nothing of the user's conversations
ever reaches the model.

**Two protocols, one class.** `Client` is the slice of Telethon the channel
uses at run time (connect, contacts, resolve, send); `LoginClient` is the
slice `assistant telegram login` uses once. `TelethonClient` is both, and
imports `telethon` inside its methods, the way `media/now_playing.py`
imports WinRT: a dependency that is missing or broken on a machine must
not stop the assistant from starting. Everything Telethon raises is turned
into a `TelegramError` with a `kind`, so that the channel's answers are
sentences and never tracebacks.

**Finding the person.** The address book first (`contacts.py`): a contact
with a `telegram` username, or with a phone the account's contact list
knows; then the contact list by name, through the same matcher as apps and
the book (`store/names.py`, `shared="nobody"`); a miss fetches the list
once more, for a contact added today. The list is fetched on first use and
kept: it is one request, and the names in it do not change mid-session.
