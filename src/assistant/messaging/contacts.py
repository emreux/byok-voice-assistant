"""The people the user can message, from `contacts.toml` (spec section 4.2).

**Why a file the user writes.** WhatsApp on Windows exposes no contact list
to another program, and the number a chat link needs has to come from
somewhere the user controls. `%APPDATA%\\assistant\\contacts.toml` sits
beside `config.toml` and `memory.toml`, under the same rules (section 10):
data, editable by hand, following the user through a roaming profile,
never in the repository. Telegram adds the account's own contact list on
top (`telegram.py`); this file is what both channels start from.

**The worst failure is a message to the wrong person, so the file is
refused rather than repaired.** A number typed without its country code is
not guessed at - the country is not knowable from here (section 3.12) -
and is found before the first send, not after it. A key nobody meant
(`phonee`) would otherwise drop the number silently and the person would
be "found" with nothing to send to. Two entries that answer to the same
name would give the message to whichever came first. Each of these stops
the assistant with a sentence naming the file and the field, the way a
`memory.toml` that does not parse does (`MemoryFileError`).

The matching is the app catalogue's (`store/names.py`), built with
`shared="nobody"`: a first name two people share names neither of them,
and the tool is handed both names to ask about.
