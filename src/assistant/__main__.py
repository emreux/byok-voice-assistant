"""Command line entry point - and the composition root of the program.

`setup` asks the questions of item 1.4, the microphone among them since
2026-09-15; `mic` asks that one again on its own. `run` is item 1.11: it
puts the pieces together, hands them to the state machine, and shows the one
line of terminal that is the entire interface until the tray icon of phase
4.2. `cost` is 2.4: what the turns cost, read back from `usage_log`. `purge --all`
is 4.6: everything the machine recorded, listed and then deleted after the
word `yes`. `doctor` arrives in phase 3 (design.md section 8).

This is the only file that knows the concrete names: which tools are on
offer, which gate runs them, where the audit rows go. `agent/core.py` sees a
registry and a gate, `agent/policy.py` sees a registry and a repository, and
neither knows what the other is called - which is what lets a test hand
either of them a fake.

Three things about `run` are decisions rather than plumbing.

**Everything heavy is imported inside the function that needs it.** `assistant
--help` should not load PortAudio, a speech model and a vendor SDK to print
four lines of help - and `run` should not load the wizard's prompt library it
will never show.

**Starting up fails in sentences.** A machine nobody has run setup on, a key
that has since been deleted from the Credential Manager, a voice that is not
installed, a speech model that could not be fetched, a microphone that would
not open: these are things the user can fix, and each gets a sentence and an
exit code - the first two before anything slow is loaded. Anything else is a
bug in this project and comes out as a traceback, for the same reason `app.py`
refuses to say "I could not connect" about one.

**The terminal is told to speak UTF-8 first.** A redirected stream gets the
machine's legacy code page from Windows, which has no `ş` and no `ğ` in it -
and the assistant would end a turn with a `UnicodeEncodeError` instead of an
answer. That is fixed here rather than by asking the user to set an environment
variable before starting their own assistant.
