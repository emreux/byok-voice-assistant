"""What a turn cost in dollars, and whether the day can afford another one
(design.md section 6 and section 3.11).

Every turn that reached the model is one row of `usage_log`: the tokens the
provider counted, and what they cost at the price of the model that
answered. `assistant cost` adds the rows up; the two spending limits of
section 3.11 are checked against the same sums, once per turn.

**The price is data, not code** (section 6). `defaults/pricing.toml` ships
the prices this build knows, and `%APPDATA%\\assistant\\pricing.toml`, if the
user writes one, is read on top of it: a price that changed is an edit, and
a model this file never heard of is a table the user adds. A model with no
price is priced at `None`, not at zero - a zero would be a made-up number
that reads as free, and `assistant cost` says the price is unknown instead.

**Cached tokens are a subset of the input, not an addition to it.** A turn
of 1000 input tokens with 400 cached is 600 fresh tokens at the input price
and 400 at the cached price. Adding the 400 to the 1000 would bill the cache
hit as a cost, which is the mistake the formula of section 6 made in version
2 of the design. A provider that reports no cached tokens reports zero, and
zero reads correctly as "no cache hit".

**The rows are UTC; the day and the month are the user's.** A row's `ts` is
an epoch second like every other time in the database (section 3.10), and
"today" is the local calendar day, which starts at a different epoch second
every day and at a different one again on the two days the clocks change.
So the boundary is computed from the local calendar and turned into an epoch
second, and the query stays a comparison of integers.

**The limits warn; they stop only if told to.** Past the day's or the
month's limit every answer starts with a warning and the assistant goes on
answering: a limit that silenced the assistant at two in the morning would
make it useless exactly when the user cannot see why. `hard_stop` in
`[limits]` is the user's decision to be silenced anyway (section 12,
decision 10).
