"""Opening the database: one file, one connection, migrated on the way in.

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\\assistant\\assistant.db` - beside the log and not beside the
settings, for the same reason: what a machine did stays on that machine and
does not follow the user through a roaming profile (section 3.3). Plain
`sqlite3` and no ORM (section 5.11, decision 4 of section 12).

Three settings are made here because they belong to the connection rather
than to any table. WAL journaling lets a reader look while the assistant
writes - the cost report of 2.4, or `sqlite3` in the owner's hand. With it,
`synchronous=NORMAL` is SQLite's own recommendation: a commit no longer waits
for the disk, and what is written survives a crash of this program, which is
the crash the `started` row of section 3.11 exists for; only the power going
out can lose the last few writes. It is what keeps the 50 ms rule of section
3.1, because a `tool_audit` row is written on the event loop before the tool
runs: measured on this machine on 2026-09-09, a start and a finish together
took 5.8 ms typically and 38 ms at worst with the default, and 0.08 ms
typically and 0.6 ms at worst with this. `Row` makes columns readable by
name, so no repository counts positions.

The path is a parameter and not an environment variable. A test passes
`":memory:"` or a path under `tmp_path`; the composition root passes nothing.
