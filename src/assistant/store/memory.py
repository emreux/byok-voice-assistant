"""What the user asked to be kept between runs (design.md section 3.7, 2.10).

Measured 2026-08-27: "adım Emre" was remembered in the next turn and
forgotten at the next start. Nothing in the design held it. The history
lives in memory and dies with the process (`agent/core.py`), the system
prompt carries no name so that its bytes never change (`agent/prompts.py`),
and the disk had only the audit rows. This is the third kind of memory,
beside the window of twelve turns and the notes of phase 4: what the user
explicitly asked to be kept, and the assistant's own name, read at startup
and put in front of every request.

**A file, not a table.** `%APPDATA%\\assistant\\memory.toml`, beside
`config.toml` and under its rules (section 10): data rather than code,
following the user through the roaming profile, editable by hand, never
holding a key. A table in the database would hide from the person whose
facts they are what is being said about them to a model.

**Small, and refused when full.** Every fact is a prefix to every request,
and Gemini gives no discount for a cached one (section 6): forty facts of
two hundred characters are about five hundred tokens, the size of the
frozen prompt itself. Past the ceiling `remember` refuses and says so.
Dropping the oldest quietly would be forgetting something the user said
not to forget.

**Only the two tools write it.** `remember` and `forget` (`tools/memory.py`)
go through the gate like every tool (invariant 1); nothing else in the
program writes here, so the file holds what the user asked for, in the
words they used. A file that does not parse - a hand edit gone wrong - is
a sentence at startup and is never written over.

**The block is composed at every request** from what this holds, not once
at startup. The loop is handed the prompt as a source rather than a
sentence (`Agent`), so "bana Emre de" holds from the next request on,
thirteen turns later when the window has dropped it, and at the next
start. The bytes change only when the facts do, which is the one time the
cache of architecture guide section 2 is meant to miss.
