"""What an audit row may still say after a month (design.md section 3.7,
phase 4.6; 17 Sep 2026).

`tool_audit` is written before every tool runs and its rows are never
deleted: the row is what makes the repeat check of section 3.11 work, and
the list of what this user opens before (`AuditRepo.names_asked`), and a
table that forgets its rows forgets both. But a row carries two things of
different weight. Which tool ran, when, and how it went is bookkeeping;
`result_summary` is the first two hundred characters of what the tool
answered - the top of a web page, the text of a note, a forecast - and
there is no reason for that to sit on a disk for years.

So the summary is blanked and the row stays. Once at every start, before
anything reads the table, every row older than `[retention] audit_days`
loses its summary. The arguments stay: the repeat check and the recogniser
read them, and they are what the user asked for rather than what the world
answered back. Notes and reminders are never touched here - the user wrote
those down to keep them, and `assistant purge --all` is the door for them.
