"""What is written to the database and how, one class per table (section 3.7).

A repository is the only code that knows a table's columns; everything else
calls a method named after what happened. `AuditRepo` is the `tool_audit`
table of 2.1d; `UsageRepo` is the `usage_log` of 2.4, where every turn's
tokens go with their price; `SettingsRepo` is the `settings` of 2.6, one
value per key, where the probe keeps its verdict on a model.

**A call is written down before it runs.** `start` opens the row with
`status = 'started'` and no `finished_at`; `finish` closes it as `ok` or
`error`. A row that stays `started` for ever is what a crash between the two
looks like, and it is kept that way on purpose: it is how the assistant says
"I tried, and I do not know whether it worked" (section 3.11) instead of
guessing. `deny` is the other shape - the gate said no, nothing ran, and one
row says so.

**A call is also written down by what it asked for.** `args_hash` is the
arguments as one line of canonical JSON, hashed: the same request always
reads the same, whatever order the model put the keys in. It is what `recent`
looks a call up by, so the gate can say "you already did this a minute ago"
(section 3.11), and what the repeat check of `agent/limits.py` counts by -
same name, same hash, same call. Never by the call's id, which Gemini leaves
empty. What it does not do is read meaning: `{"to": "a@x.com"}` and
`{"to": "A@x.com"}` are two calls, and the design accepts a missed repeat
over a reported one that never happened.

Every write is one transaction (`with connection:`), and every time is a Unix
epoch second in UTC (section 3.10): local time is for the screen, never for
the file.
