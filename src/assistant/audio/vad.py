"""Live end-of-speech detection: where a sentence began and where it ended.

This is what turns an open microphone into turns. Push to talk asks the user to
say where the sentence ends by letting go of a key; here nobody is holding
anything, so the audio has to answer the question itself (design.md section
3.4, item 2.9).

**The model is the one `faster-whisper` already ships.** `faster_whisper.vad`
carries Silero's ONNX weights and pulls in `onnxruntime` to run them, so live
detection costs this project neither a new dependency nor a download that can
fail on a machine with no network. Nothing else in the project imports it.

**It is driven frame by frame with the recurrent state kept, and that is the
whole difference.** `SileroVADModel.__call__` builds fresh LSTM state on every
call and consumes a whole array at once - exactly right for a finished
recording, and wrong for a microphone that never stops. The session underneath
takes `h` and `c` and hands back `hn` and `cn`; keeping them between frames is
what makes the answer about *now* rather than about 32 milliseconds in
isolation. That is why this module reaches for `.session` instead of the
convenience wrapper above it.

**Measured on this machine: 0.14 ms per 32 ms frame.** That is 0.4% of one core
to listen continuously, so rule 4 of section 3.1 is in no danger and the energy
pre-filter section 3.4 allows is not written: it would buy back a fraction of a
percent in exchange for a second threshold, and a threshold that is wrong cuts
quiet speech instead of saving power.

**The frames before the onset are kept.** A detector confident enough to fire is
already a few frames late, and those frames hold the first consonant of the
sentence. `PREROLL_SECONDS` is the ring buffer that gives them back.

**An utterance has a ceiling.** A microphone left open in a room with a
television would otherwise collect until the machine runs out of memory, and
then hand Whisper an hour of it. At the ceiling what has been collected is
handed over and the detector goes back to waiting for a new sentence.
