"""Playing the answer out loud (design.md item 1.10).

The TTS layer yields raw PCM and deliberately stops there: sixteen bit signed
mono at the rate the engine declares, whether it came from Windows or from a
cloud voice. This file is the other end of that - the only place in the project
that opens an output device.

Two things shape it.

**Writing audio blocks for as long as the audio lasts.** PortAudio's `write`
returns when the sound card has room, which for a five second answer means five
seconds. Rule 4 of section 3.1 gives anything awaited in `app.py` fifty
milliseconds, so all of it happens in a worker thread.

**Speech has to stop the instant the user presses the key.** That is why the
audio goes out in blocks rather than in one write, and why an interrupted
answer is *aborted* rather than stopped: a sound card holds up to a second of
audio, and draining it politely would mean talking over the user for a second
after being told not to.

**The device failing is the device's problem, not the program's.** A Bluetooth
headset switched off between two answers raises out of PortAudio; here that
becomes `PlaybackError`, which `app.py` writes down and moves on from - the
words are already on the screen. Only the device's own calls are wrapped: an
engine that fails while producing the audio is a bug or an outage, and keeps
its own traceback.

The device itself is injected, so the tests are about what was written rather
than about what was heard.
