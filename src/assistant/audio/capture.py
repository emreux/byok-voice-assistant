"""Being listened to: press a key once, and talk.

`HandsFree` keeps the microphone live and lets `audio/vad.py` decide where
each sentence begins and ends; one key, `Ctrl+Alt+H`, turns that listening
off and on again. Until 2026-09-11 there was a second way - holding
`Ctrl+Alt+Space` and letting go - and the first phases were built on it. The
owner removed it: one key with one meaning, and the assistant is either
listening or it is not (design.md section 12, decision 17).

Three threads meet in this file and only one of them owns the state.

* **PortAudio's callback thread** delivers the microphone blocks. The array it
  passes is its own scratch buffer and is overwritten on the next callback, so
  it is copied before it goes anywhere.
* **The keyboard listener's thread** reports the toggle. It flips a plain
  `threading.Event` so that the audio callback starts - or stops - showing
  blocks to the detector in the same instant, without waiting for the event
  loop to get around to it.
* **The event loop** owns the detector, the finished sentences and the window
  below. Both other threads reach it only through `call_soon_threadsafe`;
  touching an asyncio object from outside the loop is a race that shows up as
  a hang weeks later.

The microphone stays open for as long as the assistant runs - opening a
PortAudio stream takes long enough to swallow the first syllable. Open is not
the same as listened to: a block that arrives while listening is off is
dropped in the callback and never reaches memory. Fifty blocks a second cross
into the event loop while it is on, each costing a fraction of a millisecond,
and none at all while it is off.

The confirmation window of phase 2.3 is the second way to be listened to.
`listen_for` takes the next sentence - whether or not listening is on - for a
few seconds, and hands it back to whoever asked instead of queueing it as a
question. What is said inside it is an answer, so its beginning is not
announced: the state machine would otherwise take the user's "yes" for a new
question and withdraw the one it was asking.
