"""The application log: what a turn cost, and nothing that could identify it.

Item 1.11 asks for one thing - the token count of every turn written down, so
that the cost report of section 6 has something to be built from in phase 2.4.
What the log does *not* contain is the more interesting half.

**The terminal belongs to the status line.** `loguru` installs a handler that
writes to stderr the moment it is imported. Left in place it would draw log
lines through the middle of the one line phase 1 has to show the user.

**Nothing said out loud is written to disk.** The numbers are; the words are
not. A voice assistant that keeps a plaintext transcript of every sentence
spoken near a microphone is a liability nobody asked for, and section 3.7's
retention rules do not arrive until phase 4.

**No API key can reach the file.** Phase 1 logs no text that could carry one,
and the sink is configured so that a traceback cannot smuggle one out in the
value of a local variable.
