"""Playing the answer out loud (design.md item 1.10).

The TTS layer yields PCM and stops there, deliberately: what plays it is the
same for Windows' own voice and for a cloud engine. This is that piece.

Two rules are worth more than the rest of the file. **PortAudio's write blocks
until the buffer drains** - the length of the sentence - so it happens in a
worker thread; rule 4 of section 3.1 gives anything awaited in `app.py` fifty
milliseconds. And **speech has to stop when the user presses the key**, which
is why the audio goes out in blocks rather than in one write: a sentence handed
over whole cannot be interrupted at all.

No device is opened here. The stream is injected, which is how the interruption
tests can be about what was written rather than about what was heard.
