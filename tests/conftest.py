"""Fixtures shared by every test that touches the user's machine.

Two things in this project are global by nature: the Credential Manager and
the settings directory. A test that used the real ones would read the
developer's own key and write into their own `%APPDATA%`, so both are
redirected here - the keyring to a backend held in memory, the settings to a
temporary directory through `ASSISTANT_CONFIG_DIR`.

The keyring backend is a real `KeyringBackend`, not a stand-in for the library.
The calls under test are the calls production makes; only the vault is fake.
