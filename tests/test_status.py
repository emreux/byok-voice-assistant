"""The terminal status line - the whole interface phase 1 has (item 1.11).

There is no window and no tray icon yet, so this one line is where the user
finds out whether the assistant heard them, is thinking, or is talking. Three
claims are worth testing.

**It says what is happening, in the user's language.** The words come from the
locale pack with the English constants of `TEXT` behind them, exactly like
every other sentence in the product (section 3.12).

**A turn leaves something behind.** The line itself is overwritten as the state
changes; what was heard, what was answered and what it cost scroll past above
it, which is the only record the user gets in phase 1.

**A terminal that is not a terminal still works.** `assistant run > run.log`
redirects the output to a file, and a status line that only knew how to draw
itself on a console would take the whole assistant down with it.
