"""The contract every provider adapter has to pass, unchanged (section 3.2).

This is the exam the project's headline claim sits: the application talks to
Anthropic, to anything OpenAI-shaped and to Gemini through one protocol, and
the way that stays true is that one suite says what an adapter must do and
every adapter is run through it. Phase 2.7 adds a second and phase 4.5 a third;
neither of them may edit a line below.

Nothing here names a vendor. The tests script a provider in the words of
`contract.py` - it says something, it asks for a tool, it reports what the
request cost, it refuses - and each adapter's own test file translates that
script into the shapes its SDK really produces. `test_every_adapter_this_build
_has_is_in_this_suite` is what stops an adapter from being added to the
registry without one.

The two claims worth reading twice:

**`Delta.tool_call` is never half-built.** Every provider streams tool
arguments as partial JSON. The adapter buffers them and emits one whole call or
nothing, because the permission gate of section 3.9 cannot judge an action it
can only see the beginning of - and by the time the rest arrives, the gate has
already run.

**A refusal arrives as one of two exceptions and never as an SDK's own.** The
application decides out loud what to say about a failure (`app.py`), and it
cannot import three SDKs to find out which of them just failed.

The `def stream` signature is the subtle part. Adapters implement it with
`async def ... yield`, which returns an `AsyncIterator` when called, with no
`await`. Declaring it `async def` in the protocol would force callers to await
first and no adapter would satisfy the type.
