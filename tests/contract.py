"""The vocabulary the adapter contract is written in (design.md section 3.2).

`test_llm_adapters.py` says what every adapter must do; it must say it without
naming a vendor, or the suite stops being a contract and becomes a second copy
of one adapter's tests. So the tests script a provider in the words below - it
says something, it asks for a tool, it reports what the request cost, it
refuses - and each adapter's own test file translates that script into the
shapes its SDK actually produces.

That translation is the mirror of the production rule: vendor knowledge lives
in the adapter, and nowhere else. Here it lives in the adapter's test file, and
nowhere else. Adding a provider in phase 2.7 is a `Build` function beside the
new adapter's tests and one more entry in the list - the contract suite itself
does not change, which is exactly the claim section 3.2 makes about the
production code.
