"""Being listened to: what reaches the detector, and what does not.

Two threads that are not the event loop reach into this module - the keyboard
listener and PortAudio's callback - so the tests drive it the same way, and
three specific traps are pinned:

* audio that arrives while listening is off belongs to nobody,
* the buffer PortAudio hands over is reused, so it has to be copied,
* the stream is opened at the rate the speech layer declares, not a plausible
  looking one. That last mistake has already been made once in this project.

No microphone and no keyboard are touched here. The devices are behind two
small interfaces; the real ones are exercised through a fake `sounddevice`
module, which is also what proves the import stays deferred.
